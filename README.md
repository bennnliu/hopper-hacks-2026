# React + Vite Setup Guide

This guide outlines the steps to create a fast, modern React development environment using Vite and Node.js.

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
* Download Node.js: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
* Verify your installation by running the following commands in your terminal:
  ```
  node -v
  npm -v 
  ```
* Look for [package.json](frontend\package.json)
* To ensure all packages are downloaded, run this command in your terminal:
    ```
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```
* Run the development server command in your terminal:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
* If there are no errors then your frontend environment is setup.
